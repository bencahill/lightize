### Lightning-fast PHP image organizer

## Watch this space
I've just started developing this image organizer after finding none other suits my needs. Here are some of its aims:

- Extremely fast (prebuilt previews)
- Full organization capabilities from multiple computers without complicated syncing (web-server model)

At the time of this writing (June 24, 2012), I haven't even written any code yet, but have everything pretty well planned out. I hope to get this to a usable state in the next few weeks, if not sooner.
